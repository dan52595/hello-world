# hello-world
This is my first repository where I will store not only the code I write learning how to use github, but also where I'll collect ideas for the future

I'm writing this up one evening that I am focusing on learning Python to work more effectively on the spooler thermal survey.

I certainly have a lot of interest in coding, but minimal experience.

As of 1/13/15, I am comfortable doing simple MATLAB and Arduino coding, but I would certainly like to expand my capabilities greatly, getting into controls, html, python, and C (and variants)
